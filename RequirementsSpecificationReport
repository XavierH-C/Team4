1. Introduction

	1.1 Purpose:

	This software requirements specification report's purpose is to describe the software system we seek to develop.
	This document was made to define all functional and non-functional requirements and communiate these to all stakeholders,
	which for this project would be the development team and the professor of our course Dr. Du. Our team has laid out 
	how this software product should function so all stakeholders can validate our use case requirements before we enter 
	the more specific system-design stage.

	1.2 Scope:
	
	The software project Team 4 will be developing is a D2L-like application. The main objective of the project is to produce software that is able to perform the core functionalities of the actual D2L application, such as create courses, view grades, update profile (etc).
	We have been limited to including twenty-one of the functions we believed to be most valuable to the end-user of the application; so, many smaller-scale functionalities of the actual D2L will not be provided. The purpose of an application as mentioned is to create
	an all-in-one platform for the modern-day university student, professor and administrator.
	Our program will be hosted  on a GitHub repository for maintenance and accessibility.
	The database will be hosted through a local desktop server dedicated to keeping the records accessible through network requests.

	1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations:

	Student: The student whos is/going to be enrolled and studying in the University for which this product is being made.
	Professor: The person in charge of managing the materials and teaching the course for which this product is being made.
	TA: Acronym- Teaching asssitant 
		Definition- The appointed person who is in charge of organizing/collecting answers and marking the students assignments as well as helping the Professor with a particular course for which this product is being made.
	Administrator: The person/s who is in charge of the administrative activities related to the courses of the university for which this product is being made.
	Contract: A legally binding document agreed upon by the customer and supplier. This includes the technical and organizational requirements, cost, and schedule for a product. A contract may also contain informal but useful information such as the commitments or expectations of the parties involved.
	Customer: The person, or persons, who pay for the product and usually (but not necessarily) decide the requirements. For the D2L product, the customer may be the University itself or the end users such as the Professors, TAs, students or the administrators.
	Supplier: The person, or persons, who produce a product for a customer. For the D2L product, the suppliers are the members of Team 4 of FR01A of CS2043 who are working on and developing the product.
	User: The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product. For the D2L product, the users are the TA, Students, Professors and the Administrators.
	
	1.4 References:
	
	This report was written in reference to the following publication;
	
	IEEE Std 830-1998 (Revision of IEEE Std 830-1993), IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
	
	1.5 Overview:

	This product is an attempt to recreate the online Learning Management System Desire2Learn. The product is aimed to take the functionalities of the D2L website for the University of New Brunswick and relicate the funtionalities that it provides.
	This product will be using the programming language of Java and integrating the database with SQL such that common functionalities and Use Cases such as viewing course, submitting assignments, marking assignments, adding course content, etc. which are  done by the Professor, TA, student or the administrator can be successfully done and the required changes are all accessible in the Database. 
	Another primary focus of this product is to keep the database secure and a successful execution of the above mentioned use cases.
	This product is being developed by the members of Team 4 in CS2043 of Section FR01A.
	The Use cases have been elaborately described in this document for better understanding.

	2.3. Constraints:

	This project is constrained by many of the requirements given by the course professor. This project must be written exclusively in Java.
	The project must be completed by Dec 5th 2019 by the 6 team members. Additional dates have also been given, for each of which another specified checkpoint must be reached.
	There will be access to a shared database server on the internet, thus internet connection is a requirement.
	There is no capital allocated.

	2.4. Assumptions and dependencies:

	It is assumed that the computer on which this program is run will have a stable internet connection as well as the processing power to handle its execution.
	The hardware used is assumed to have a functioning, updated version of Java with all necessary libraries.

	2.5. Apportioning of requirements:

	At the moment, there are no requirements that may be delayed until future releases of the system.

3. Specific requirements

	3.1 External interface requirements

		The user interface will be built upon the JavaFX framework, which is a software requirement itself.

		3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
		
		Since we don't require any low-level programming to acheive our projrct, all hardware interfaces are
		goint to be managed by the Java programming language's default hardware handling classes.

		Our program will have to interact with a couple of software interfaces.
		Some interfaces required are the JavaFX framework, the user's operating system, and our data storage system.

	3.3 Performance requirements

	For the proper perfomance of our proposed system, the user will need any modern computer than has access to a desktop computer which has a
	stable internet connection, any of the three modern operating system (windows, macOS or linux based OS), and the a functional and updated
	Java runtime enviroment.

	3.4 Design constraints

	The design constraints come from the limited experience of our small team, and the short time constraint of our project deadline.
	The accessibility of the user should also be taken into accound in order to make our graphical user interfaces as simple to use
	and adaptible as possible.

	3.5 Software system attributes

		3.5.1 Reliability

		Our proposed system will be a downloadeble Java bundle, which can be reliably run anywhere if the hardware
		and software requirements are met.

		3.5.2 Availability

		The availability of our program is greatly lengthen since we will host a GitHub repository that will make our
		project available to anyone on the internet as long as we keep the project posted and GitHub keeps hosting it.

		3.5.3 Security

		Our security plan is to have multiple layers that validates requests along each use cases' controller and 
		data manager to ensure no malicious requests are sent to our database. This validation will scan for SQL
		injections and other scriptic language, assure that the data requested is in a user's defined priviliges,
		and finally handle any errors that occur with the transer of data. The project bundle will also be locked
		upon deliverence to customers to discourage modification of the executing code.

		3.5.4 Maintainability

		With properly defined use case UI and controller classes, the fixing of bugs should be straightforward as the
		dedicated support should be able to identify which segment is to fault.

		3.5.5 Portability

		The application's Java bundle can be easily sold or transfered to a machine through standard file sharing methods
		such as downloading from a site, storage device, or network request. The database will be hosted through a
		local desktop server dedicated to keeping the records accessible through network requests.

	3.6 Other requirements

	Other requirements could be our project deadline that limits our potential development time, the workload from other courses
	and part-time work that could also affect development time.
